        <h3>Paolozzi Mosaic Project</h3>
        <div class="info-mosaic">

                <h4>Background (Have subtitles as drop down?)</h4>
                <p>In 1979 Eduardo Paolozzi was commissioned by London Regional Transport to create a public artwork for Tottenham Court Road Tube Station (TCR). Covering over 950 square metres in mosaics, Paolozzi designed an artwork in images of everyday life, references to visual culture, and the locality and nearby attractions like the British Museum. This commission included archways over the escalators going down and back up from the main entrance hall.  In total there were six archways within two structures.  There were four separate designs, one on each side of the two structures. Images on the first and second archway were modelled on watch straps- a nod to the commuters checking the time as they rushed for a train.  The third and fourth designs were inspired by an Egyptian panel in the nearby British Museum.

                In 2011 Transport for London (TfL) announced plans for a Crossrail station and other redevelopments at TCR. While restoration plans were developed for the mosaics on the platforms and in the rotunda area, the arches were to be removed from the station as part of the expansion of the entrance hall. Agreeing with contractors and structural engineers that the arches could not be retained in the new station, the Paolozzi Foundation accepted that the arches were to be dismantled and removed.
                Despite this decision, led by the heritage organisation 20th Century Society, the public and media protested against the removal of the arches and campaigned for them to be saved.  Unfortunately, it emerged that arches were removed from the station in January 2015. With pressure from the public and 20th Century Society, TfL agreed to make plans to store fragments that were deemed saveable and find them a new home.
                Coming to Edinburgh.

            <p>
                In February 2015 TfL made contact with the University of Edinburgh to see whether the fragments could form part of the University’s Art Collection.  Following discussions, in June 2015 the University of Edinburgh was officially announced as the institution that would be gifted the remainder of mosaic fragments. The University’s Art Collection is an appropriate home.  Paolozzi was from Leith and his professional history began in the north at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA). He returned later in his career as a visiting professor, giving lectures to ECA students. He continued to have a strong connection with Edinburgh that carries on today through his art. At the University, Paolozzi is the most represented artist in the art collection.

                In October 2015 over 600 fragments arrived in Edinburgh and were unpacked in ECA’s Sculpture Court. Over five days staff and students carried out some basic conservation, cataloguing and rehousing of each fragment.

                Although it was highly likely that not all the material had survived the removal, it was not clear how much was actually lost. This uncertainty determined the University’s next steps for management of the fragments. Over the next three months each fragment was photographed by John Bryden. As well providing a digital record of each fragment this work allowed for collaborations with the School of Informatics. Led by the Chair in Computer Vision, Professor Bob Fisher, and PhD student Alex Davis, this collaboration set out to digitally map each fragment against the original designs using the MATLAB programme. Each photograph was scanned into the image recognition software and a matched location was generated. This provided vital knowledge regarding fragment location but also complicated plans for their redisplay with the discovery that only 33% of the arches survived the removal from the station.  Fisher and Davis’ complied data and images estimated that the material gifted to the University amounts to 12.0  of the colour tile area of the artwork.

                Exploring the Aftermath
                </h4>
            <p>
                The data produced by Informatics raised many questions. Faced with a partial artwork do you attempt to reconstruct it in its original form?  Or do you keep the arches in their fragmented form? If so, how do you redisplay them? Deciding what to do with the material is an exciting, challenging project for the art collection team, the wider University and city.  In August 2016 a Public Art Officer was hired to oversee the future of the project. Over ten months the Public Art Officer carried out research, ran events, developed and managed a series of consultations around the project to determine the most appropriate use for the mosaics.
                Consultations includes a number of handling sessions and a dedicated symposium in February 2017 organised by the University as well as talks as part of national and international events including Vandalism and Art Conference in June 2017 and British Association for Modern Mosaics (BAMM) Annual Forum in September 2017.  At each event attendees were invited to discuss the project and make suggestions for use of the fragments. As well as forming part of the external, public consultancy around the project this also enables a sense of ownership in the wider community for a public artwork that had come from London. Integration in teaching played a key part in the University being gifted the arches. Since their arrival in Edinburgh students have been involved at every stage of the project. Specifically, the mosaics have been integrated into the Edinburgh Collections undergraduate course.

            <h4>Next Stages and the Future
                </h4>
            <p>
                Following ten months of research, consultation and reflection, two points of consensus were reached. It was agreed that, firstly, the mosaics should be redisplayed as a public artwork and secondly they should not be remade in their entirety.  Their original context in the public realm and the story of what had happened to them was a key part of their identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well as these conclusions, two options were identified for their future form and use. Firstly, the fragments could be redisplayed in the form of the archway or as part of an entrance. In this way, the link to the functional, historical intention of the original artwork would be retained.  Consistently the suggestion of achieving this by creating ‘a ghost arch’ was suggested. The arches would be redrawn and the fragments would be placed in their location. Areas of loss would be visible and outlined with the redrawn design to allow reference to the complete artwork. This would allow for a sympathetic and conservation based approach to the fragments redisplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as well as losing more than half of the arches, there were other losses to consider. Many who knew and worked with Paolozzi closely felt that creating a ghost arch would be inappropriate and would overlook the spirit of his work. At its core his artworks explored what he referred to as ‘the metamorphosis of rubbish’ and played with ideas of recycling, reconfiguration, accumulation, and collage of material.  The opportunity to engage with these ideas seemed ripe with the mosaic fragments.   Moreover, it also was important to remember that the artwork had never been located in Edinburgh. The recreation of a work that had never existed in the city could risk becoming a tragic monument that failed to celebrate the artist or the artwork but only focused on the story of the artwork’s removal from the London tube station and subsequent loss. In order to both celebrate Paolozzi, his work and tell the arches’ story the fragments could be recreated into something new. A competition process would be organised to obtain artists’ proposals for a new work. This new work could then be displayed on campus as part of the art collection.  This second option allowed for a contemporary yet loyal solution given the level of damage, the loss of original context and relocation to Edinburgh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Agreeing that the material and contextual loss were too great, the art collection team favoured the idea of using the material for the creation of something new. Following this decision, the art collection team met with the Paolozzi Foundation in October 2017 to update the trustees and seek their support.  At this meeting plans for a new chapter of the mosaics history was fully agreed upon and a competition for artists’ proposals is currently being developed.
